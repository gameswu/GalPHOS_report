\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
% 简单介绍项目的内容和情况

GalPHOS (Galaxy Physics Online System) is a physical competition event management system based on the web platform, covering a variety of functions including event registration, exam management, and score statistics. The system is designed to provide an efficient and convenient management platform for physics competitions, supporting a variety of user roles, including administrators, students, coaches and graders.

Our system architecture and functions are based on the life cycle design of a competition, including five stages: registration, pre-match preparation, answer submission, post-match marking, result statistics and archives. The figure below illustrates the workflow of the system.

\section{Usage and Features}
\subsection{Administrator}
\subsubsection{Admin Management}
We have a super administrator account initialized along with the system, which has username and password both initialized but can be changed later. All other administrators are added by
the super administrator later, and super admin can manage them by adding, deleting, banning and password reseting.
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{admin/adminmanage.png}
%     \caption{Admin management page}
%     \label{fig:adminmanage page}
% \end{figure}

Except the admin management
function, the other administrators are able to manage the system in the same way as the super administrator.
\subsubsection{Dashboard}
The admins' dashboard shows information about the system, including the number of registers, number of active users, number of provinces and schools,
information about the exams and so on.
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{admin/dashboard4admin.png}
%     \caption{Admin management page}
%     \label{fig:adminmanage page}
% \end{figure}
\subsubsection{User Management}
Administrators can check and manage users in the user management page: administrators can access the detailed information of
the users, including their username, phone number, region, status and other information,
for registering users, administrators can approve or reject their registration requests, and for existing users, administrators can ban or unban them,
and delete them if necessary.
The user management page also provides a search function, allowing administrators to search for users by username, phone number, region,
status and other criteria.
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{admin/usermanage-1.png}
%     \caption{UserManagement page: registering users}
%     \label{fig:UserManagement page}
% \end{figure}
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{admin/usermanage-2.png}
%     \caption{UserManagement page: registered users}
%     \label{fig:UserManagement page}
% \end{figure}
\subsubsection{Region Management}
In region management page, administrators can access and manage the active regions and schools in the system. In the 'Province management'
part, administrators can add, delete provinces and add schools to provinces. And in the 'School management' part, administrators can
access the detailed information of the schools, including their name and belonging region.
% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{admin/region-overview.png}
%     \caption{Region management page}
%     \label{fig:RegionManagement page}
% \end{figure}
\subsubsection{Region Changing Management}
In realistic life, some students may change their region or school after registration, so the region changing management page is designed to
manage the region changing requests from students. After the student submits a region changing request,
the administrators can check the request and approve or reject it. If approved, the student's region will be updated accordingly.
This page provides a dashboard showing the number of requests, and a table showing the detailed information of the requests
and allowing administrators to work on the requests on it.

%     \caption{Region changing management page}
%     \label{fig:RegionChangingManagement page}
% \end{figure}
\subsubsection{Exam Management}
The exams are managed by the administrators in the exam management page. Administrators can access the information of the exams, or create, delete and modify exams here.
The dashboard shows the number of exams, and the table shows the detailed information of the exams, including their name, start time, end time, status and other information and
provides a filter function to filter the exams by status.
% \begin{figure}[H]

%     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{admin/exammanage.png}
%     \caption{Exam management page overview}
%     \label{fig:ExamManagement page}
% \end{figure}
The exams have total five states: 'Not Published', 'Published', 'In Progress', 'Finished' and 'Graded'.
To create an exam, administrators need to provide basic exam information: title, detailed information, number of questions, total score,
time limit, start time and end time, and the files of test paper, answer sheet and solution.

We also provide the function to save
current exam as a draft with the state 'Not Published', so that administrators can modify it later.
After the exam is published, other users can see the exam in their pages, and the exam will automatically change its state to 'In Progress' when the start time is reached and
end its state to 'Finished' when the end time is reached. Only when in the 'In Progress' state, students can submit their answer.
In the 'Finished' state, the answer sheets can be distributed to the graders by the administrator and the graders can grade the answer sheets in the 'Graded' state.
After all answer sheets are graded, the exam will automatically change its state to 'Graded', and the results will be calculated and stored in the database
so that users can check their results later.
\subsubsection{Grading Management}
After a exam is finished, the administrators can distribute the answer sheets to the graders in the grading management page.
In this page, administrators can check the current status of the system, including the number of answer sheets to be graded, the number of graders,
and the progress of grading. The administrators can assign different questions to different graders, while the grading service
will automatically assign the questions to the graders based on their availability and workload.
